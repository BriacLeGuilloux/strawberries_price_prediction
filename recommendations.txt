## Recommendations for Improvement

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
Explore lagged weather-price correlations
Include production and consumption data


2. Feature Engineering
Revisit lagged correlations
Add insights on "good production" and "bad production" interpretation
Include external data (e.g. holidays, market events)
Try feature selection methods and robust scaling


3. Modeling
Test SARIMA, Prophet, LSTM, Transformer models
Use validation sets for deeper evaluation with optimisation of hyperparameters

4. Evaluation
Analyze errors by season and model failure cases


General
Add testing
